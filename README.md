# Fake_News_Detection
This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using a combination of machine learning and deep learning models. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains labeled real and fake news articles which were preprocessed through tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
# Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/therealsampat/fake-news-detection
# Models:
Three models were implemented:
• Naive Bayes – lightweight probabilistic classifier achieving 93% accuracy.
• Random Forest – ensemble model achieving 100% accuracy on the test set.
• LSTM – deep learning sequence model achieving 99% accuracy.
# Evaluation Metrics
TF-IDF vectorization was used for traditional models, and tokenization with padding was applied for the LSTM. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, along with visual comparisons through bar charts and ROC curves.

This project demonstrates how different approaches can be applied to text classification problems, and highlights the performance differences between classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning models.
